/*
Following are some important points about friend functions and classes:
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
3) Friendship is not inherited
4) The concept of friends is not there in Java.
